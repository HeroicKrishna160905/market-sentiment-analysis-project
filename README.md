# market-sentiment-analysis-project
## Overview
This project aims to create a **Market Sentiment and Condition Analyzer** to help **traders and businesses** gather useful insights about the market. 

We start by analyzing the **correlation between real-time market price changes and sentiment data** from **news sources and social media**. Additionally, we generate **alerts from keyword data** collected from various sources to track how frequently certain market-moving terms appear.

Next, we incorporate **SEC earnings call transcripts** to analyze financial statements and detect potential indicators of upcoming market movements. Finally, we gather **macroeconomic data** from the **FRED website** to assess the overall economic condition and provide a deeper understanding of market health.
