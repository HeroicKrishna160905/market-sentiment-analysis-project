2025-03-28T20:49:04.000Z,"I highlight this because while the current trend is to Ghibli-ize people from pictures, over a year ago there were already people doing this sort of thing. The landscapes in particular were shocking.

The new capability of Ghibli-ize *precise* pictures is what made it catch on."
2025-03-28T20:49:04.000Z,"I found a January 2024 screenshot I took back then on MidJourney of someone asking it to create a Ghibli-inspired landscape.
